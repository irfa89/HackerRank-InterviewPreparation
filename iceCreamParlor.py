Given the value of money and the cost of each flavor for  trips to the Ice Cream Parlor, help Sunny and Johnny choose two
distinct flavors such that they spend their entire pool of money during each visit. ID numbers are the 1- based index
number associated with a cost. For each trip to the parlor, print the ID numbers for the two types of ice cream that Sunny
and Johnny purchase as two space-separated integers on a new line. You must print the smaller ID first and the larger ID second.
